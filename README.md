String Resources for Imgur Sync, available for translation.


## How To

1. Fork Repository
2. Create new Branch
3. Create folder for your language (values-xx, where xx is the two letter language code)
4. Create strings.xml and google_play.txt in this folder
5. Copy contents of values/strings.xml into this your file and translate every string that is not marked translatable=false.
6. Copy contents of values/google_play.txt into your file and translate every string
